# Reading Sessions
This charitable project aims to create a website for a cat shelter. The website will serve as a platform to raise awareness and support for the shelter, as well as provide information about its activities, feline residents, and ways to contribute. Through an intuitive interface, users can learn about adoptable cats, donate towards medical care and upkeep, and even volunteer. Developing the website will efficiently enhance and expand the shelter's operations in the online sphere.
